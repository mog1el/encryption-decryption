# Encryption-decryption

## A fully functional Python encryption/decryption program!

This project helped me to learn about:

* Python
* Encryption methods
* XOR
* Binary representation of numbers
* Changing the form of numbers
* Checking if the file contains information
* Numbers generation
* Reading files 

## How to install and run this project?

1. Clone the project
2. Make sure that you have Python installed
3. Run the Python file
4. Generate a key (you won't need to generate one later)
5. Enter the message that you want to encrypt
6. Click ENTER and watch it run

## What if you want to decrypt a message?

1. Make sure that your message and key are in their places (in .txt files)
2. Run the program and look when it gives you an answer

## How does the encryption work?

1. The code looks through every letter, assigns it its corresponding number value and changes the value to binary
2. The code opens the key file and changes each number to a binary number
3. The code repeatedly iterates through every number from the key and xors it with the one from a letter
4. The value is changed to an integer and written in a file
